<h1>About</h1>
<p>Allmende - known as <q>tragedy of the commons</q> is an often occuring of a problem where the available ressources aren't used at their fullest potential.</p>
<br>
<p>To adress this kind of problem in a different way, I've come up with an idea of assigning tasks that are not very popular randomly to all the participating users. This includes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Every user of allmende can create tasks with a title and description</li>
    <li>Every user can see the tasks that were created</li>
    <li>The administrator can assign the tasks with a random algorithm to the different users</li>
    <li>Every user can see the assignee of each task</li>
</ul>
