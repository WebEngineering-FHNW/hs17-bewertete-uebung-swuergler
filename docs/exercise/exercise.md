# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 16-660-631

Project idea short description: 
If you're in a group, there tasks that no one wants to do
or feels responsible for (Clean blackboard, empty trash or whatever).
Often the same person is doing this job.

This web application should be a simple solution for this problem.

* Every user can add tasks with a small description
* All the created tasks should be visible for the users
* The Administrator of the group can randomly and automatically assign the tasks
* Every user can view the assigned tasks


## Project confirmation

Confirmed.

This problem is usually called "tragedy of the commons" where the Swiss word
is probably "Allmende" (this might be a good name for your project).
I look very much forward to see your solution.
